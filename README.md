# Osu!Cents

A two key touch keyboard for [Osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) 

Just get a Sparkfun Pro Micro (or clone), print this [case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2973458), upload the sketch and go!

You just need two 1M Ohm resistors. One between pin 5 and 8 and one between pin 10 and 15. Furthermore you need two short cables. One at pin 5 and one at pin 15. The other end of the cables get connected to the 5 euro cent coins (please look at the pictures at [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2973458)).

The cable at pin 5 is the 'z' key.
The cable at pin 15 is the 'x' key.

Have fun!
